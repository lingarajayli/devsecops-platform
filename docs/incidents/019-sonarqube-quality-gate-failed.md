# Incident #019: SonarQube Quality Gate Failed

## Scenario

A production workload shows the following incident:

```text
SonarQube Quality Gate Failed
```

Impact: users may experience failed requests, slow responses, failed deployments, or unavailable services.

---

## Meaning

Code did not meet the required quality, reliability, maintainability, coverage, or security standards.

Important point:

Do not guess the root cause. Start from observable evidence: events, logs, metrics, configuration, and recent changes.

## Common Causes

- Low test coverage
- Code smells
- Duplicated code
- Bug detected
- Security hotspot
- Vulnerability

## Investigation

### Goal

Identify the safest and most likely root cause using evidence.

### Investigation Flow

1. Confirm scope and impact.
2. Check recent deployments or configuration changes.
3. Check events, logs, and metrics.
4. Identify the failing layer.
5. Apply the safest remediation.
6. Verify recovery.
7. Document the incident.

### Key Commands

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.lastTimestamp
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace> --previous
kubectl get nodes
kubectl describe node <node-name>
```

For CI/CD incidents:

```bash
git status
git log --oneline -5
git diff HEAD~1
```

### Evidence to Collect

- Incident start time
- Affected service
- Error message
- Recent deployment or config change
- Logs
- Metrics
- Events
- Current version
- Previous known-good version
- Remediation applied

---

## Example Root Cause

Quality gate failed because new code coverage dropped below the required threshold.

---

## Remediation

Fix the failed quality metric or document a justified exception before merging.

Verify recovery:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.lastTimestamp
```

---

## Prevention

- Add monitoring and alerting
- Add CI/CD validation
- Review configuration changes carefully
- Keep rollback steps documented
- Add post-deployment smoke tests
- Keep runbooks updated
- Use production change reviews

---

## Interview Answer

`SonarQube Quality Gate Failed` means code did not meet the required quality, reliability, maintainability, coverage, or security standards.

I would confirm the impact, check recent changes, inspect events/logs/metrics, identify the failing layer, apply the safest remediation, and verify recovery. I would avoid random restarts and troubleshoot using evidence.

---

## Follow-up Interview Questions

- How would you confirm the root cause?
- What logs, metrics, or events would you check first?
- How would you prevent this from happening again?
- When would you roll back?
- What would you document after recovery?

## LinkedIn Draft

Today I documented production-style incident #019: SonarQube Quality Gate Failed.

Key lesson:

Troubleshooting should be evidence-based, not guess-based.

My investigation flow:

1. Confirm impact
2. Check recent changes
3. Check logs, metrics, and events
4. Identify the failing layer
5. Apply the safest fix
6. Verify recovery
