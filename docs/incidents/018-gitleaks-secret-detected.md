# Incident #018: Secret Leak Detected by Gitleaks

## Scenario

A production workload shows the following incident:

```text
Secret Leak Detected by Gitleaks
```

Impact: users may experience failed requests, slow responses, failed deployments, or unavailable services.

---

## Meaning

Secret scanning detected credentials or tokens committed to the repository.

Important point:

Do not guess the root cause. Start from observable evidence: events, logs, metrics, configuration, and recent changes.

## Common Causes

- API key committed
- AWS key leaked
- Token in .env
- Private key committed
- Hardcoded password

## Investigation

### Goal

Identify the safest and most likely root cause using evidence.

### Investigation Flow

1. Confirm scope and impact.
2. Check recent deployments or configuration changes.
3. Check events, logs, and metrics.
4. Identify the failing layer.
5. Apply the safest remediation.
6. Verify recovery.
7. Document the incident.

### Key Commands

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.lastTimestamp
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace>
kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <namespace> --previous
kubectl get nodes
kubectl describe node <node-name>
```

For CI/CD incidents:

```bash
git status
git log --oneline -5
git diff HEAD~1
```

### Evidence to Collect

- Incident start time
- Affected service
- Error message
- Recent deployment or config change
- Logs
- Metrics
- Events
- Current version
- Previous known-good version
- Remediation applied

---

## Example Root Cause

A `.env` file containing an API token was accidentally committed.

---

## Remediation

Revoke and rotate the secret immediately, remove it from the repo, and prevent recurrence.

Verify recovery:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.lastTimestamp
```

---

## Prevention

- Add monitoring and alerting
- Add CI/CD validation
- Review configuration changes carefully
- Keep rollback steps documented
- Add post-deployment smoke tests
- Keep runbooks updated
- Use production change reviews

---

## Interview Answer

`Secret Leak Detected by Gitleaks` means secret scanning detected credentials or tokens committed to the repository.

I would confirm the impact, check recent changes, inspect events/logs/metrics, identify the failing layer, apply the safest remediation, and verify recovery. I would avoid random restarts and troubleshoot using evidence.

---

## Follow-up Interview Questions

- How would you confirm the root cause?
- What logs, metrics, or events would you check first?
- How would you prevent this from happening again?
- When would you roll back?
- What would you document after recovery?
